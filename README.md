# K-Means-Clustering

In this project, I have used K-means clustering for image compression.With the two images provided,
• Displayed the images after data compression using K-means clustering for different values of K (2, 5, 10, 15, 20).
• Obtained the compression ratios for different values of K?
• Compared the tradeoff between image quality and degree of compression, Computed a good value of K for each of the two images.
